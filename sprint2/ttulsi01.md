# What you did not do
* I added a script from firebase to log in with Facebook but it's not working completely. I need to fix this issue.

# What problems you encountered
* After user login with the email/password it should clear their email and password and redirect to the login page. I could not get that to work.

# What you accomplished
My main responsibility was to fix the search bar and add google/Facebook/(email/password) sign-in authentication. I fixed the search bar on the home page. I used firebase to add authentication on the login page. we created a Suggestify project on firebase to use for multiple purposes. I used javascript from firebase docs to help me write my code. Also, I watched multiple videos to understand how authentication works. As a group, we met twice a week to discuss what we worked on and the problems that we encountered. For the next sprint, I will work on fixing the Facebook sign-in Authentication.
