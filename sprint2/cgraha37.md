### What problems you encountered
<ul>
<li>We decided to used a different carousel than the one I created in sprint 1. I wanted to use 
    a Tailwind elements carousel as there was an option for a fade transition between slides.</li>
<li>There was an issue preventing me from utilizing the Tailwind Elements so we temporarily 
    switched from a tailwind project to a bootstrap project.</li>
<li>As the trending carousel was created completely with Daisy UI (which is dependant on Tailwindcss) 
    and there were no good bootstrap substitutions, we switched back to Tailwind</li>
</ul>

### What you accomplished
After the team decided on which carousel to use from the preview carousel, code was 
added to the index.html.js to implement it. The carousel was going above the navbar 
at first so I had to add a bit of css to fix that. I also added a few filler trailers to it 
to demonstrate its functionalities. Currently, the trailers are being ran via youtube
iframes but in the future the API will be utilized. After the carousel, I implemeted a
basic settings page with html and css.
