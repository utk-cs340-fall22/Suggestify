### What you accomplished
In this sprint I was able to fix a number of issues with the preview carousel. It is now sized correctly; displays not only the trailer, but also information about the movie when clicked; and I implemented a timed slide function automatically moves to the next slide. I also added information about the team to the settings page and implemented a password reset function.
