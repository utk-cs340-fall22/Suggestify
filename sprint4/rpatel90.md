### What you accomplished
For this sprint, I worked on adding more features to the carousels on the main page. I got the trailers working and playing in every carousel. I also added more stuff to the details page in the modal box such as cast list and watch providers. I populated the other tabs in the modal box, one of them being reviews. I pulled reviews from the API and formatted them properly in the boxes. Lastly, I also added the see also page in the modal box so now users can find similar movies to what they selected. Furthermore, when users hover over the movies in the see also page, it will pop up the rating for the movie.
