# Background

    Often, when people sit down to watch a movie or series they end up wasting their half of time 
    deciding which show they want to watch. So, we came up with an application where a user can 
    find a movie or series that they would like to watch according to their mood and choice at that time. 

# Project Overview

    Oftentimes, people sit down by themselves or with a group of friends, and they end up spending 
    too long trying to find the perfect movie or show to watch by sifting through Google and all of 
    their streaming services. This project would help users quickly find something to watch based 
    on the userâ€™s inputs. The application will be designed to be used by anyone.
