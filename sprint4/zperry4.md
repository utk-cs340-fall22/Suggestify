### What you accomplished

During this sprint, I accomplished the rest of my tasks. I first worked on [issue #70](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/suggestify.github.io/issues/70), which aimed to fix a bug relating to the filtering and page numbers. When navigating throughout different pages and then selecting a filter, the page would not reset back to one. This bug fix fixed that for both the movies and tv shows pages. Next, I worked on [issue #76](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/suggestify.github.io/issues/76), which aimed to fix another bug relating to missing posters and background images. Now, if one is missing, it will replace it with the other. If neither of them exist, it will display a blank square. Finally, I worked on [issue #71](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/suggestify.github.io/issues/71), which was the biggest issue I had this sprint. The goal was to add a ton of information to each of the pop up modals for the movies and tv show pages. The information includes trailers, cast info, reviews, and similar movies. This took me a while to complete but I was successful in adding all of the info to the modals for both pages.
