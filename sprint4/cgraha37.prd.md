Product Name: Suggestify

## Background
Have you ever really wanted to watch something, but didn't know what was popular at the time? Or maybe you've been in the mood for a particular genre, but didn't know where to find good suggestions. There should really be some kind of website that allows people to browse new and popular movies that fit the vibe of the day, night, or hangout sesh. That's where Suggestify comes in, the future of recommendations.

## Project Overview
Suggestify is a website that will allow users to browse movie and tv genre's and bring hidden gems to their attention. Users will have the option to either investigate the selections on the spotlight carousel, peruse the various collection carousels, filter by genre, or use the search function to find the perfect match for their mood. After their account is created, users may also "heart" any number of movies and tv shows as reminders for the future. While content will not be directly available on Suggestify, all the information that a user will need to make a confident and informed decision will be readily present in a neat and concise manner.

## Features
Give at least 8 user stories to describe required features. These can come from the issues assigned to you during the 4 sprints, or you 
can create new items. Give a title or feature name for each story. Example: 
1. **Create Account.** As a new user, I want to register by creating a username and password so that the system can remember my washlist.
2. **Password Reset.** Whenever I forget my password, I just navigate to the Suggestify settings page, enter my email, and have a password reset email sent directly to me. It's a real life saver!
3. **Viewing the Spotlight Carousel.** I'm a busy college student so when I want to make a decision, it needs to happen fast or not at all. The Spotlight Carousel is great for finding big titles.
4. **Landing Page Carousels.** Sometimes I just get on Suggestify to see what's popular or trending. The landing page carousels allow me to browse hundreds of big titles and see what I've been missing out on!
5. **My List.** When I come across a movie or tv show that looks interesting to mebut doesn't fit my mood I just add it to my list. It's really helpful when keeping track of titles on my radar.
6. **Search Function.** There are times when I'm not exactly sure what I want to watch but have a vague idea. The search function allows me to search key terms and words and return a number of movies and tv shows involving my search.
7. **Suggest Function.** I love to be surprised, the "suggestify" button returns a wide variety of movies an tv shows based on my list.
8. **Filtering by Genre.** Filtering the movies and tv shows by genre allows me to browse hundreds of titles that fit my mood. There's even an option to filter for kids!
