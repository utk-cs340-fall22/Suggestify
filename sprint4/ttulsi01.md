# What you accomplished

For this sprint, I worked on the login page and search page. I was having a problem login in with google but I finally got it to work with help of my team member. Now, the user can create a new account and log in with his email and password. Also, I created a new search page and added some new functionality where users can search for different kinds of movies and series, as well as users, can search based on keywords. I created new search.js files to write a script that fetches all the data for search functionality from the TMDB. As a group, we worked together and help each other with the issues we encountered.
