## What you accomplished

* I was responsible for the watch list feature and connecting it to the database so data is persisted when page is refreshed or cache is cleared.
* Added heart feature to each movie/tv-show card so user can add/remove movie/tv-show of choice to a centralized location (watch list).
* Fixed a lot of bugs that occured because of how asyncronous code works (lost some hair in the process).
* Added a new page that fetches data from database and displays in two different sections - movies and tv-shows.
* Upon initial page load, movies/tv-shows that are already in database will have a filled heart to signal its existence in database.
* Updated the git blame script so only sprint 4 commits are accepted.
