### What you accomplished
I was responsible for adding the trending movie carousel. I used Daisy/Tailwind to get the html for the carousel and since we didn’t have a movie API integrated into our code yet (it’s something we’re planning on doing in sprint 2 because we have the API picked out already), I just searched some of the trending movies and used their posters. I also added a feature where the movie is slightly highlighted/emphasized when hovered over so the user can see which movie they’re hovering over.
