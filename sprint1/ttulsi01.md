# What you accomplished
My main responsibility was working on the login page and adding a search bar on the main page. I wrote my code in HTML and CSS. Also, I watched videos and used online resources to help me write my code. For the next sprint, I will work on improving the search bar. Also, I will work on the login page to login with the Google and Facebook. As a group, We met twice a week to discuss what we worked on and the problems that we encountered.
