</ul>

### What problems you encountered
<ul>
<li>I wasn't able to size the the carousel in the CSS correctly, utimately deciding how it was sized already was correct</li>
<li>Trying to add a gradient to darken the bottom of the carousel was difficult as Daisy UI may have some kind of priority over CSS</li>
<li>The carousel buttons are unappealing so I will have to build new ones</li>
</ul>

### Issues you worked on

</ul>
</ul>

### Files you worked on
<ul>
<li>index.html</li>

### What you accomplished
I Provided the main carousel located in the hero section of the home page. It 
will be used to show trailers of the items selected from the other carousels and 
will have an idle slide show of movie posters. I also designed and edited a good 
portion of the figma drawing of the home page and <em>suggested</em> the name "Suggestify".
