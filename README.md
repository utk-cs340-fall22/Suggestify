# Project Name: Suggestify

**Note: The website is slow when initial loading because of youtube trailers inside of modal popup.**

## Summary

The project would be an application where users will be able to find a movie or tv show that they would like to watch according to their mood and choice at that time.

## Problem to solve

Oftentimes, people sit down by themselves or with a group of friends, and they end up spending too long trying to find the perfect movie or show to watch by sifting through Google and all of their streaming services.
