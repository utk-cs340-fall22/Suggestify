# Sprint 3

name: Riya Patel
github id: rpatel90
group  name: Suggestify

### What you planned to do
* Issue #63: [get the multiple tabs feature in the modal box functioning](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/suggestify.github.io/issues/63)
* Issue #64: [get the trailers to play in the modal box](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/suggestify.github.io/issues/64)
* Issue #65: [add more carousels to the home page with different categories](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/suggestify.github.io/issues/65)

### What you did not do
* format the trailer to play in the bottom left corner of the modal box
* pulled more details from the api for the modal box

### What problems you encountered
We encountered issues with the API which set us back on time by a couple of days. The way we had initially set up our fetch calls and other functions for the API weren’t working when we tried to access other things like runtime and trailers. Once we spent some time trying to essentially redo that part of our code, everything worked much more smoothly and we were able to pull a lot more information from the API.

### What you accomplished
For this sprint, I wanted to add more carousels to the main page. I added carousels with lists of movies and tv shows such as latest movies, trending tv shows, etc. Adding the carousels was a very tricky process because there were many small details that, if I didn’t pay special attention to, I could have easily made a mistake with and would have lost hours trying to fix it. While I ran into a few issues, because I took my time writing the functions, I didn’t run into anything major that caused my code to stop working. Furthermore, I worked on the modal boxes and added more information to them. I added a carousel inside the modal box so that users will be able to view different “pages” inside the modal box such as more details about the movie/show, reviews people have left about the movie/show, and movies/shows similar to this one. One of the most difficult parts was adding the trailer to the modal box, but while it’s not correctly formatted, it’s in the box and it works.
