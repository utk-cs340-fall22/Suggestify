### Issues you worked on
<ul>
<li>Preview Carousel JS #28</li>
  <ul><li>https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/suggestify.github.io/issues/28</li></ul>
<li>Change Preview Carousel to display Posters rather than Trailers #75</li>

<li>Settings Page Functionality #67</li>
  <ul><li>https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/suggestify.github.io/issues/67</li></ul>
</ul>

### Files you worked on
<ul>
<li>index.html</li>
<li>index.js</li>
<li>settings.html</li>
<li>settings.css</li>
</ul>

### What you accomplished
This time around I was able to dig into the index.js file to access the trailers for the
preview carousel. We decided to convert the preview carousel into a poster carousel, 
but it still plays trailers when clicked. It functions by way of Daisy Ui model boxes
much like the smaller carousels. The settings page is now a bit more functional as users
have actual input boxes to update info. The javascript for those functionalities are not
up to standard yet but will be very soon.
