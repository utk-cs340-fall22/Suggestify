### What I did not do

* I accomplished everything I planned for this sprint.

### What problems I encountered

* I mainly ran into issues with connecting the firebase with frontend specifically, adding movies/shows to the list.

* There are still few bugs that I'll have to fix in sprint 4.

### Files I worked on

* [index.js](../index.js)
* [my-list.html](../my-list.html)
* [tv.html](../tv.html)
* [tv.js](../tv.js)
* [movies.html](../movies.html)
* [movies.js](../movies.js)

### What I accomplished

* Connected the landing page carousel with firebase so users can now store their favorite movies/tv-shows.
* Added hearts to each movie/tv-show so users have a way to add to list.
* Adding a counter to list so users can see how many movies/tv-shows they have in the list.
