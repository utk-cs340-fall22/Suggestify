# What you accomplished
My main responsibility was to implement the search functionality, add a footer, and work on sign-in authentication. I added a footer at the end of the main page. I used TMDB to get the API for multi/search links, movies, and tv-series and used javascript to add posters, movie names, and some other functionality. Also, I implemented a sign-in authentication.  As a group, we met twice a week to discuss what we worked on and the problems that we encountered. For the next sprint, I will work on creating a new search page and fixing the Facebook sign-in Authentication.
